This repo is mainly made to demonstrate how NextJS 13 features work on AWS-based infrastructure. It contains simple configurations for 3-rd party services (Flightcontrol, SST) as well as Dockerfiles for self-hosted solutions.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
